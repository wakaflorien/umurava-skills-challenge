                        <p className="text-black  text-lg leading-8">With 3 years of experience matching African digital talents to local and global job markets, we still remain with a big number of jobs that remain unfilled due to the lack of experienced African Talents. Driven by our mission to place skilled and professional digital talent, we created Skills Challenges as a project-based learning solution for talents to gain real-world experience, solve problems, and build portfolios so that they become ready for global job markets.</p>
